        <p>This is my final project for this course.  <br>
            
        <p> I chose to do an education app for my project, which is designed to help kids learn facts about a certain topic. I designed it to make it very kid-friendly, as they will be able to use the interactive app in a very fun away. It is as simple, tapping the screen, to open the new slides, which will be the future of education for young children. <br>
        
        <p> For the topic, I took geology and made slides with each being a certain chapter of geology, namely: the Earth and Sun, Rocks, Mineral and Weather (more specifically rain). In this app, I made slides for each of this chapter and put up facts about it. The project ends with the option to show "rain fall", which is something kids using the app might find amusing. <br>
